This is a hack to use flowd and pybgp to collect netflow info and add BGP info
to it.

There is some code to do SNMP requests too, mainly to get interface
information, but it's far from complete.

The general concept would be to insert it into a postgresql database and then
use SQL queries to aggregate and refine the information further. No functions
to refine data are integrated into this.

I am currently uncertain whether to proceed with this project or focus my
efforts on pmacct instead.
